# Seismic-Analysis-G4-RCC-Building
This project focuses on the seismic analysis and design of a G+4 reinforced concrete (RCC) residential building using the Response Spectrum Method as per the guidelines of IS 1893:2016. The objective is to evaluate the building’s structural response under lateral loads induced by seismic activity.

Key aspects of the project include:

-3D structural modeling and analysis of the G+4 RCC frame system

-Assessment of storey drift, base shear, natural frequency, and mode shapes under seismic excitation

-Design and detailing of beam–column framing, slabs, and reinforcement zones ensuring compliance with IS 456 and IS 13920

-Application of dynamic load combinations, load cases, and modal analysis using STAAD.Pro

-Preparation of structural layout drawings and detailing using AutoCAD

The project demonstrates how seismic forces influence structural behavior and ensures that the design adheres to performance-based earthquake-resistant criteria, ensuring ductility, resilience, and safety of the building under seismic events.
